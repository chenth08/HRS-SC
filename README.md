# HRS-SC
We collect 1800 samples from a sphere placed in three different positions within the robotâ€™s workspace, as shown in Fig. S.2. Each sample primarily includes six robot torsion angles, a draw-wire length, and a micrometer reading. The samples from these three positions correspond to three sub-datasets, i.e., HRS-S1, HRS-S2, and HRS-S3. This paper randomly selects 120 samples from each of HRS-S1, HRS-S2, and HRS-S3, respectively, referred to as S1, S2, and S3.
